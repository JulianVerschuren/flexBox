			<h2>The band Bad Company:</h2>
			<p>Bad Company are an English hard rock supergroup formed in Westminster, London, in 1973 by two former Free band members—singer Paul Rodgers and drummer Simon Kirke—as well as Mott the Hoople guitarist Mick Ralphs and King Crimson bassist Boz Burrell. Peter Grant, who managed the rock band Led Zeppelin, also managed Bad Company until 1982.

Bad Company enjoyed great success throughout the 1970s. Their first three albums, Bad Company (1974), Straight Shooter (1975), and Run With the Pack (1976), reached the top five in the album charts in both the UK and US. Many of their singles, such as "Bad Company", "Can't Get Enough", "Good Lovin' Gone Bad", and "Feel Like Makin' Love", remain staples of classic rock radio.

<h3>Discography:</h3>
<p>Bad Company discography consists of twelve studio albums, and five live albums. Additionally, they have released 29 singles and 6 music videos.

Although being a British band, Bad Company had more success in the United States than in the United Kingdom. Four of their albums were certified Gold by the British Phonographic Industry, while another four other albums were certified Multi-Platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America. Bad Company's most successful album was their 1974 debut, Bad Company. It was a Number One album on the Billboard 200 and also made the Top 3 on the UK Albums Chart. This album featured their biggest hit, "Can't Get Enough", which is their only Top 5 single on the Billboard Hot 100 and their highest charting single on the UK Singles Chart, where it reached #15 in 1974.
